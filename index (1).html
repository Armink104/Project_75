    <h4>New School Canteen</h4>

    <p class="list-group-item-list-item-success col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Outside the United States,
       the development of cafeterias (Canteen) can be observed in France as early as 1881 with the passing of the 
       Ferry Law. This law mandated that public school education be available to all children. Accordingly, the 
       government also encouraged schools to provide meals for students in need, thus resulting in the conception 
       of cafeterias (Canteen) or cantine (in French). According to Abramson, prior to the creation of cafeterias, 
       only some students were able to bring home-cooked meals and able to be properly fed in schools.

      As cafeterias in France became more popular, their use spread beyond schools and into the workforce. Thus, due 
      to pressure from workers and eventually new labor laws, sizable businesses had to, at minimum, provide established 
      eating areas for its workers. Support for this practice was also reinforced by the effects of World War II when the 
      importance of national health and nutrition came under great attention.[7]</p>

    1.  Accuaracy Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them supporting computational divices. Automated attendence 
    management systems ensure acurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors manual data entry. This accurate 
    data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and patroll data.
    <br>
    2.Economics Have you ever thought that attendence management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to 
    inaccurate time repporting, buddy punching, absenteesim, tardiness, time abuse and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study 
    done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save upto $1,600 per emloyee after implementing Automated attendace 
    management systems.
    <br>
    3. Productivity/Efficiency monitaing and managing attandance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious and expensive affair. 
    It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create shedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll system. 
    The time and efort saved combined  with data accuaracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased Productivity 
    and improves profit. And many more like visibility / Insights, Hassle Free WorkFlow Management, Flexibility, Intergation / Confuguration,
